Write a function, format_poem() that takes a string like the one line example as an argument and returns a new string that is formatted across multiple lines with each new sentence starting on a new line when you print it out.

Try to solve this challenge with the str.split() and the str.join() string methods.

Every sentence will end with a period, and every new sentence will have one space before the previous period. Be careful about trailing whitespace in your solution.
