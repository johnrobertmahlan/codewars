# Codewars

Recently I started working through the katas on codewars. I decided to create this repository to hold my solutions to those katas. 

Mostly I am doing this for fun, so none of the solutions have been refactored after passing the tests on codewars. Instead, I'm just posting the first solution I came up with for each kata. This solution is not always the most efficient way to solve the problem, but since I'm doing this for fun in my free time, that's okay.
